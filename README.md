The MQ-2 smoke sensor is sensitive to smoke and to the following flammable gases
LPG
Butane
Propane
Methane
Alcohol
Hydrogen
The smoke sensor has a built-in potentiometer that allows you to adjust the sensor sensitivity according
to how accurate you want to detect gas

# how it work
The voltage that the sensor outputs changes accordingly to the smoke/gas level that exists in the atmosphere. 
The sensor outputs a voltage that is proportional to the concentration of smoke/gas.
